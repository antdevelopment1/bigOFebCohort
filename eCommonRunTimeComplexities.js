// ==========
// Question:
// ==========
// What are the common runtime complexities we will talk about today?

// O(N), (f(n) = n) Linear- As n scales as the input the runtime scales as well
//O(1), (f(n) = 1) Constant - As n grows it doesnâ€™t have much impact because the runtime is always constant
//0(N*N) or O(N^2), (f(n) = n2) Quadratic - As n grows the runtimes squares related to the square of n


// Other common runtime complexities. There are more but these are the most common ones.
// Logarithmic: O(log n)
// Lineararithmic: O(n log n)
// Cubic: O(N^3)
// Exponential: O(2n)
// Factorial: O(n!)

// Good picure of all runtime complexities
